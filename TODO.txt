# remove aligner

# add PPI level false discovery rate

i.e in gen_feat dump protA protB GOall to file 

In collapse read that file instead of the complex and then calculate the filtering from the ppi. After remove members for which the GO threshold < threshold PPI then remove again  if #members less than 2

# perform differential protein analysis across all proteins into all the matrixes then select complexes
